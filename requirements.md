# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a tic-tac-toe game with a Next.js frontend and Python backend AI opponent. The AI will demonstrate various search algorithms including minimax, alpha-beta pruning, and depth-limited search. The system serves as both an interactive game and an educational tool for understanding AI search algorithms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to play tic-tac-toe against an AI opponent, so that I can enjoy a challenging game experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user starts a new game THEN the system SHALL display a 3x3 grid with empty cells
2. WHEN the user clicks on an empty cell THEN the system SHALL place the user's symbol (X) in that cell
3. WHEN the user makes a move THEN the AI SHALL automatically make its move within 2 seconds
4. WHEN three symbols align horizontally, vertically, or diagonally THEN the system SHALL declare the winner
5. WHEN all cells are filled without a winner THEN the system SHALL declare a draw
6. WHEN a game ends THEN the system SHALL offer an option to start a new game

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student learning AI, I want to see different AI algorithms in action, so that I can understand how they work in practice.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects an AI algorithm THEN the system SHALL use that algorithm for the AI's moves
2. WHEN the AI is thinking THEN the system SHALL display which algorithm is being used
3. WHEN the AI makes a move THEN the system SHALL optionally show the evaluation process
4. IF minimax is selected THEN the AI SHALL use the minimax algorithm with game tree exploration
5. IF alpha-beta pruning is selected THEN the AI SHALL use minimax with alpha-beta optimization
6. IF depth-limited search is selected THEN the AI SHALL use minimax with configurable depth limits

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a learner, I want to understand the AI's decision-making process, so that I can learn how search algorithms evaluate game states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user enables visualization mode THEN the system SHALL display the AI's thought process
2. WHEN the AI evaluates positions THEN the system SHALL show position scores and evaluations
3. WHEN using alpha-beta pruning THEN the system SHALL highlight pruned branches
4. WHEN using depth-limited search THEN the system SHALL show the search depth being used
5. IF the user requests it THEN the system SHALL display the game tree being explored
6. WHEN the AI selects a move THEN the system SHALL explain why that move was chosen

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean separation between frontend and backend, so that the system is maintainable and scalable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs AI moves THEN it SHALL communicate with the Python backend via API
2. WHEN the backend receives a game state THEN it SHALL return the AI's move and optional analysis
3. WHEN the frontend sends requests THEN the backend SHALL validate the game state
4. IF invalid game states are received THEN the backend SHALL return appropriate error messages
5. WHEN the system starts THEN both frontend and backend SHALL be independently deployable
6. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL include proper error handling and timeouts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want configurable AI difficulty levels, so that I can adjust the challenge to my skill level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects difficulty THEN the system SHALL adjust the AI's search parameters
2. IF easy mode is selected THEN the AI SHALL use limited depth or introduce randomness
3. IF medium mode is selected THEN the AI SHALL use standard minimax with moderate depth
4. IF hard mode is selected THEN the AI SHALL use optimized algorithms with full depth
5. WHEN difficulty changes THEN the system SHALL update the AI behavior immediately
6. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL display the current difficulty level

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want access to educational content about the algorithms, so that I can learn the theoretical concepts behind the implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user requests algorithm information THEN the system SHALL display explanations of minimax
2. WHEN the user views alpha-beta pruning THEN the system SHALL explain how it optimizes minimax
3. WHEN the user explores depth-limited search THEN the system SHALL show how depth affects performance
4. IF the user wants examples THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step algorithm walkthroughs
5. WHEN algorithms are running THEN the system SHALL optionally show real-time algorithm state
6. WHEN the user completes games THEN the system SHALL provide performance comparisons between algorithms
